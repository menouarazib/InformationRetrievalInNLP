#   Introduction
In this work, we propose an innovative approach by adapting the technique used for Event Detection in Multivariate Time Series Data (https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/uabjg) to address tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically keyword extraction and the identification of adjectives for part-of-speech tagging (POS) in textual data.
